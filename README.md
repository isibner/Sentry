# Sentry

### Continuous Integration for Code Quality

You might write a `// TODO` comment or ignore a test and forget about it, but Sentry is always on the watch. Sentry constantly watches your codebase to provide a birds-eye view of your source code. You can track code cruft and other metrics and view them all in the Sentry app, or roll your own display by pulling that data as JSON. Sentry is also fully pluggable - you can write your own metrics as **services** and pull from any Git source with **source providers**.
