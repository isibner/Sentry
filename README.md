# Sentry

### Continuous Integration for Code Quality

Sentry constantly watches your codebase to provide a birds-eye view of your source code, tracking all kinds of code cruft in plain JSON (or prettier HTML). It is fully pluggable - you can write your own metrics as **services** and pull from any Git source with **source providers**.
